### Minimum Requirements

- In the search bar, type **Eventin**.
- Once you see Eventin in the results, click **Install Now**.

If you prefer manual installation, download Eventin from the WordPress plugin directory and upload it using FTP or cPanel.

- Download and unzip the plugin file.
- Upload the unzipped folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site using FTP or cPanel.
- Go to **Plugins > Installed Plugins** in your dashboard and click **Activate**.
